This data mining project focuses on extracting key performance metrics from sensor data of an Artificial Pancreas system. 
It involves synchronizing data from two sensors, computing statistical measures, 
and extracting metrics related to hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and time intervals. 
The analysis is performed for both manual and auto modes of the system, 
considering data asynchronously collected from Continuous Glucose Sensors and insulin pumps. 
The project culminates in the generation of a Results.csv file containing 18 metrics. 
The evaluation is based on the accuracy of the extracted metrics with a 10% error limit.
